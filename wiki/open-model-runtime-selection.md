# Open Model Runtime Selection

This page compiles the model/runtime decisions surfaced by the Notion source pages from `🔗 링크 정리`, especially the Gemma 4 and Qwen 3.6 entries.

## Current Working Heuristic

- Use a small local open model when privacy, cost control, or on-device responsiveness matters.
- Use a stronger hosted model when the answer depends on deeper reasoning over weakly structured evidence.
- Separate retrieval quality from model quality; a stronger model does not fix missing citations.
- Treat context-window pressure as a first-class routing signal, not a secondary benchmark detail.

## Gemma 4 Signal

- Gemma 4 is notable because it frames small open models as agent-ready runtimes rather than toy local models.
- The E2B and E4B line is especially relevant for laptop-class deployment.
- Source notes highlight four sizes: E2B, E4B, 26B MoE, and 31B Dense.
- Apache 2.0 matters operationally because it lowers friction for commercial use, internal deployment, and fine-tuning.
- The strongest design implication is that local structured-output agents are now practical enough for product workflows, not only demos.
- Gemma-class local runtimes are strongest when procurement or data-governance pressure makes self-hosting a product requirement, not just a cost preference.

## Qwen 3.6 Signal

- Qwen 3.6 pushes the opposite frontier: long context, stronger coding performance, and aggressive price/performance in API form.
- Source notes claim a 1M-token context window, multimodal support, and repo-scale coding workflows.
- The practical takeaway is that a cheap hosted reasoning layer may beat a purely local stack when the workload needs deeper synthesis across large corpora.
- The important signal is not just price, but the combination of very long context and coding-agent compatibility.
- Official compatibility with agent shells such as Claude Code, Cline, and OpenClaw is a deployment signal: ecosystem fit can matter as much as raw benchmark wins when the real question is adoption friction.

## Decision Rule For This Wiki

- Start with a local model when:
  - the wiki is closed-world
  - the source corpus is modest
  - latency and privacy matter
  - the main need is summarizing or shaping already-retrieved evidence

- Escalate to a stronger model when:
  - retrieved evidence is broad and conflicting
  - the answer needs stronger synthesis than formatting
  - the local model repeatedly underperforms on the same decision class
  - the task genuinely benefits from repo-scale or corpus-scale context

## Routing Thresholds

- Prefer the local default when the answer can be assembled from a few wiki pages plus short supporting excerpts.
- Escalate when context management itself becomes the problem:
  - a large repository must be reasoned over as one unit
  - the source set is too broad to chunk safely
  - the question depends on reconciling many competing signals at once
- Do not escalate just because a benchmark looks better; escalate when the workload shape actually matches the benchmark advantage.
- Prefer hosted escalation sooner when the model is already available inside the enterprise control plane or cloud platform you must use; procurement and integration friction can dominate pure token economics.

## Current Recommendation

- Keep `gemma4:e4b` as the default local answer-shaping runtime.
- Treat larger or hosted models as optional final reasoners, not mandatory defaults.
- Improve the wiki and retrieval layer before blaming the model for weak answers.
- Treat a long-context hosted model as the fallback for codebase-wide synthesis, benchmark-sensitive coding tasks, or cases where chunking would distort the answer.

## What To Add From Future Notion Links

- benchmark claims only when they affect an actual design decision
- deployment constraints
- pricing thresholds
- latency or memory implications
- product fit: local runtime, hosted API, or hybrid

## Current Tradeoff Snapshot

- Gemma-style local runtimes are strongest when:
  - privacy and control dominate
  - the corpus is already curated
  - structured outputs and tool use matter more than frontier reasoning depth
- Qwen-style hosted runtimes are strongest when:
  - context length is the primary bottleneck
  - coding-agent workflows need broader synthesis
  - price per million tokens materially changes viability
- Neither model class compensates for weak retrieval, stale source curation, or vague task framing.
